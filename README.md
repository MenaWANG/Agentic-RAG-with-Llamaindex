# Agentic-RAG-with-Llamaindex

This is my code and studynote for the course [Building Agentic RAG with LlamaIndex](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/building-agentic-rag-with-llamaindex/) ðŸ“š

# Lesson 1. Tools Calling with a Router Engine

* In standard RAG, LLM are mainlysed used forr synthesis of information only.
* A router engine adds additional functionality which enable LLM to determine whether to implement a Q&A or a summarization query engine/tool based on the question from the user
* See `L1_Router_Engine` notebook & `get_router_query_engine()` in `utils`

# Lesson 2. Tool Calling & Infer Parameters

* In this interation, the LLM not only helps choosing the appropriate tool but also infer necessary arguments for execution. 
* The end result is that users get to ask more questions and receive more preciese results.
